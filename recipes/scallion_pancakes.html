<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
<h3>Pancakes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting work surface</li>
  <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
  <li>Up to 1/4 cup toasted sesame seed oil [NOTE: use canola oil instead!]</li>
  <li>2 cups thinly sliced scallion greens</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dipping Sauce</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons Chinkiang or rice wine vinegar</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon finely sliced scallion greens</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
</ul>

<h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Place flour in bowl of food processor (see note). With processor running, slowly drizzle in about 3/4 of boiling water. Process for 15 seconds. If dough does not come together and ride around the blade, drizzle in more water a tablespoon at a time until it just comes together. Transfer to a floured work surface and knead a few times to form a smooth ball. Transfer to a bowl, cover with a damp towel or plastic wrap, and allow to rest for 30 minutes at room temperature, or up to overnight in the fridge [NOTE: at least 4-5 hours makes these much tastier]</li>
  <li>Divide dough into four even pieces and roll each into a smooth ball. Working one ball at a time, roll out into a disk roughly 8-inches in diameter on a lightly floured surface. Using a pastry brush, paint a very thin layer of sesame oil over the top of the disk. Roll disk up like a jelly roll, then twist roll into a tight spiral, tucking the end underneath. Flatten gently with your hand, then re-roll into an 8-inch disk.</li>
  <li>Paint with another layer or sesame oil, sprinkle with 1/2 cup scallions, and roll up like a jelly roll again. Twist into a spiral, flatten gently, and re-roll into a 7-inch disk. Repeat steps two and three with remaining pancakes.</li>
  <li>Combine all the sauce ingredients and set aside at room temperature.</li>
  <li>Heat oil in an 8-inch nonstick or cast-iron over medium-high heat until shimmering and carefully slip pancake into the hot oil. Cook, shaking the pan gently until first side is an even golden brown, about 2 minutes. Carefully flip with a spatula or tongs (be careful not to splash the oil), and continue to cook, shaking pan gently, until second side is even golden brown, about 2 minutes longer. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Season with salt, cut into 6 wedges. Serve immediately with sauce for dipping. Repeat with remaining 3 pancakes.  </li>
