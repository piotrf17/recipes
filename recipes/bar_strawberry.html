<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 cup old-fashioned rolled oats — gluten free if needed</li>
  <li>3/4 cup white whole wheat flour — or substitute all-purpose flour or 1:1 baking flour to make gluten free</li>
  <li>1/3 cup light brown sugar</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
  <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter — melted (or substitute melted coconut oil to make vegan/dairy free)</li>
  <li>2 cups small-diced strawberries — about 10 ounces, divided</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon  freshly squeezed lemon juice — from about 1/2 small lemon</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar — divided  </li>
</ul>

<h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Place a rack in the center of your oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. Line an 8x8-inch baking pan with parchment paper so that the paper overhangs two sides like handles.</li>
  <li>In a medium bowl, combine the oats, flour, brown sugar, ginger, and salt. Pour in the melted butter and stir until it forms clumps and the dry ingredients are evenly moistened. Set aside 1/2 cup of the crumble mixture, then press the rest into an even layer in the bottom of the prepared pan.</li>
  <li>Scatter half of the strawberries over the crust. Sprinkle the cornstarch evenly over the top, then sprinkle on the lemon juice and 1/2 tablespoon of the granulated sugar. Scatter on the remaining berries, then the remaining 1/2 tablespoon sugar. Sprinkle the reserved crumbs evenly over the top. You will have some fruit showing through.</li>
  <li>Bake the bars for 35 to 40 minutes, until the fruit is bubbly and the crumb topping smells toasty and looks golden. Place the pan on a wire rack to cool completely (you can speed this process along in the refrigerator).</li>
</ol>
