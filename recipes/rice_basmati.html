<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2 cups basmati rice (14 oz)</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
  <li>3 1/3 cups water (or closer to 3 cups when rinsing)</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon salt  </li>
</ul>

<h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
<p>
  Rinse rice in several changes of cold water until water runs clear. Drain well in a fine-mesh sieve. Melt butter in a 4-quart heavy pot over moderate heat, then add rice and cook, stirring, 2 minutes. Stir in water and salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and cook, covered, until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Let stand, covered and undisturbed, 5 minutes. Fluff rice gently with a fork.
