<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
<ul>
  <li>½ pound (2 sticks) butter (excessive!)</li>
  <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
  <li>½ cup pine nuts or chopped walnuts</li>
  <li>6 to 8 cups coarse fresh bread crumbs(see tip)</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh tarragonor sage leaves, or 1 teaspoon dried tarragon or sage, crumbled</li>
  <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
  <li>½ cup chopped scallions</li>
  <li>½ cup chopped fresh parsley leaves</li>
</ul>

<h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Melt butter over medium heat in a large, deep skillet, Dutch oven or casserole. Add onion and cook, stirring, until it softens, about 5 minutes. Add nuts and cook, stirring almost constantly, until they begin to brown, about 3 minutes.</li>
  <li>Add bread crumbs and tarragon or sage and toss to mix. Turn heat to low. Add salt, pepper and scallions. Toss again; taste and adjust seasoning if necessary. Add parsley and stir. Turn off heat. (You may prepare recipe in advance up to this point; refrigerate, well wrapped or in a covered container, for up to a day before proceeding.)</li>
  <li>Pack into chicken or turkey if you like before roasting, or roast in an ovenproof glass or enameled casserole for about 45 minutes, at 350 to 400 degrees; you can bake this dish next to the bird, if you like. (Or you can cook it up to 3 days in advance and warm it up right before dinner.)</li>
</ol>
