<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 1/2 cups glutinous (sweet) rice</li>
  <li>1 1/3 cups well-stirred canned unsweetened coconut milk</li>
  <li>1/3 cup plus 3 tablespoons sugar</li>
  <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds, toasted lightly</li>
  <li>1 large mango, peeled, pitted, and cut into thin slices (at least 24)</li>
</ul>

<h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
<ol>
  <li>In a bowl wash rice well in several changes of cold water until water is clear. Soak rice in cold water to cover overnight.</li>
  <li>Drain rice well in a sieve. Set sieve over a large deep saucepan of simmering water (sieve should not touch water) and steam rice, covered with a kitchen towel and a lid, 30 to 40 minutes, or until tender (check water level in pan occasionally, adding more water if necessary).</li>
  <li>While rice is cooking, in a small saucepan bring 1 cup coconut milk to a boil with 1/3 cup sugar and salt, stirring until sugar is dissolved, and remove from heat. Keep mixture warm.</li>
  <li>Transfer cooked rice to a bowl and stir in coconut-milk mixture. Let rice stand, covered, 30 minutes, or until coconut-milk mixture is absorbed. Rice may be prepared up to this point 2 hours ahead and kept covered at room temperature.</li>
  <li>While rice is standing, in cleaned small pan slowly boil remaining 1/3 cup coconut milk with remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, stirring occasionally, 1 minute. Transfer sauce to a small bowl and chill until cool and thickened slightly.</li>
  <li>To serve, mold 1/4 cup servings of sticky rice on dessert plates. Drizzle desserts with sauce and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Divide mango slices among plates.</li>
</ol>
