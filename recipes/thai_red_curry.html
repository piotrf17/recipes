<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
  <li>1 medium yellow onion, medium dice</li>
  <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more for seasoning</li>
  <li>2 medium green bell peppers, seeds and ribs removed and cut into 1/4-inch strips</li>
  <li>4 medium garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon peeled and finely chopped fresh ginger (from about a 1-1/2-inch piece)</li>
  <li>3 tablespoons Thai red curry paste</li>
  <li>1 (13- to 14-ounce) can unsweetened regular coconut milk</li>
  <li>1/2 cup water</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
  <li>1 medium kabocha squash (about 2 1/2 pounds), peeled, seeded, and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
  <li>2 teaspoons freshly squeezed lime juice</li>
  <li>1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro</li>
  <li>Steamed white rice or steamed brown rice, for serving</li>
</ul>

<h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
<p>
Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat until
shimmering. Add the onion and 1 teaspoon of the salt and cook,
stirring occasionally, until the onion has softened, about 6
minutes. Add the peppers, garlic, and ginger, stir to combine, and
cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
</p>
</p>
Add the curry paste, stir to coat the onion-pepper mixture, and cook
until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the coconut milk, water, soy
sauce, and remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt, stir to combine, and bring
to a simmer.
</p>
</p>
Stir in the squash, return to a simmer, reduce the heat to medium low,
and continue to simmer, stirring occasionally, until the squash is
fork-tender but still firm, about 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the pan
from the heat and stir in the lime juice. Taste and season with salt
as needed.
</p>
<p>
  Sprinkle with the cilantro and serve immediately over steamed rice.
