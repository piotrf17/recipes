<h2>INGREDIENTS (Matzo Ball)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>4  large eggs</li>
  <li>¼  cup schmaltz (rendered chicken fat), coconut oil or vegetable oil (kosher for Passover)</li>
  <li>¼  cup chicken stock or vegetable stock</li>
  <li>1  cup matzo meal</li>
  <li>¼  teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
  <li>1 to 2  tablespoons freshly grated ginger</li>
  <li>2  tablespoons finely chopped parsley, dill or cilantro</li>
  <li>1  teaspoon salt, more for cooking</li>
  <li> Black pepper  </li>
</ul>

<h2>INGREDIENTS (Soup)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 Tbsp vegetable or canola oil</li>
  <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
  <li>1 yellow onion</li>
  <li>3 carrots</li>
  <li>3 stalks celery</li>
  <li>1 chicken breast (about 3/4 lb.)</li>
  <li>6 cups chicken broth</li>
  <li>2 cups water</li>
  <li>Freshly cracked pepper</li>
  <li>Few sprigs fresh dill</li>
</ul>

<h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
<ol>
  <li>In a large bowl, combine the eggs, schmaltz, stock, matzo meal, nutmeg, ginger and parsley. Season with 1 teaspoon salt (only if matzo meal is unseasoned) and a few grinds of pepper. Gently mix with a whisk or spoon. Cover and refrigerate until chilled, about 3 hours or overnight (30 minutes seems fine).</li>
  <li>Mince the garlic and dice the onion, celery, and carrots. Sauté the garlic, onion, celery, and carrots with the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat until the onions are soft and transparent (about five minutes).</li>
  <li>Add the chicken breast, chicken broth, 2 cups water, some freshly cracked pepper, and one or two sprigs of dill to the pot. Place a lid on the pot and let it come up to a boil. Once it reaches a boil, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Once the matzo ball mix has refrigerated and stiffened up, begin to form it into ping pong sized balls. Drop the balls into the simmering soup as they are formed, returning the lid to the pot after each one. Once all the matzo balls are in the soup, let them simmer for 20 minutes without removing the lid. Make sure the soup is gently simmering the entire time.</li>
  <li>Add a couple sprigs of fresh dill just before serving.  </li>
</ol>
