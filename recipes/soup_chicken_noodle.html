  <li>1-1/4 teaspoons pepper, divided</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
  <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
  <li>1 garlic clove, minced</li>
  <li>10 cups chicken broth</li>
  <li>4 celery ribs, chopped</li>
  <li>4 medium carrots, chopped</li>
  <li>2 bay leaves</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme or 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme</li>

  <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
</ul>

<h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Pat chicken dry with paper towels; sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon pepper and salt. In a 6-qt. stockpot, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken in batches, skin side down; cook until dark golden brown, 3-4 minutes. Remove chicken from pan; remove and discard skin. Discard drippings, reserving 2 tablespoons.</li>
  <li>Add onion to drippings; cook and stir over medium-high heat until tender, 4-5 minutes. Add garlic; cook 1 minute longer. Add broth, stirring to loosen browned bits from pan. Bring to a boil. Return chicken to pan. Add celery, carrots, bay leaves and thyme. Reduce heat; simmer, covered, until chicken is tender, 25-30 minutes.</li>
  <li>Transfer chicken to a plate. Remove soup from heat. Add noodles; let stand, covered, until noodles are tender, 20-22 minutes.</li>
  <li>Meanwhile, when chicken is cool enough to handle, remove meat from bones; discard bones. Shred meat into bite-size pieces. Return meat to stockpot. Stir in parsley and lemon juice. Adjust seasoning with salt and remaining 3/4 teaspoon pepper. Remove bay leaves. Yield: 10 servings (3-1/2 quarts).</li>
