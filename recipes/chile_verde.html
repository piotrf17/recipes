<h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Puree 2 cups chicken broth, 1/4 of tomatillos, green onions, cilantro with stems, and garlic in blender. Set salsa verde aside.</li>
  <li>Brush heavy large pot with oil; heat over medium-high heat. Sprinkle pork with salt and pepper and dust with flour. Working in batches, add pork to pot; cook until browned, turning occasionally, about 4 minutes per batch. Using slotted spoon, transfer pork to bowl.</li>
  <li>Pour off all but 1 tablespoon fat from pot (add oil if needed). Add onion to pot; saut√© until soft, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle cumin seeds over; cook until onion is golden and cumin is toasted, about 2 minutes. Add remaining tomatillos; cook until tender and browned in spots, stirring occasionally and reducing heat to medium if browning too quickly, about 8 minutes.</li>
  <li>Return pork and any juices to pot. Add 2 cups reserved salsa verde, 1 cup broth, chiles, and oregano. Cover; simmer over medium-low heat until pork is tender, about 2 hours. DO AHEAD: Can be made 3 days ahead. Cool slightly. Chill uncovered until cold, then cover and keep chilled. Bring to simmer before continuing.</li>
  <li>Add potatoes to pork. Simmer until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Stir in remaining salsa verde; bring to simmer. Thin with additional broth, if desired. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
  <li>Divide chile verde among bowls. Top with cilantro and dollop of red chile salsa.</li>
</ol>
