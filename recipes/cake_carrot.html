  <li>1.5 cup sugar</li>
  <li>1 cup oil</li>
  <li>3 eggs</li>
  <li>2 cups flour</li>
  <li>1.5 teaspoon cinnamon</li>

<h2>Cream cheese frosting</h2>

<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>

<ul>
  <li>16 oz cream cheese</li>
  <li>4 cups powder sugar</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon vanilla</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
</ul>

<h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>

<p>
Beat cream cheese, vanilla, and milk then slowly add powdered sugar.
You could probably omit the milk since I think the frosting might have
been too runny.  There was a little extra frosting, so a half batch
would be enough if you only want to frost the top of the cake.
