<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>1 tbsp green tea powder (matcha), suitable for baking [note: 1.25 might be better]</li>
  <li>½ tsp baking soda</li>
  <li>½ tsp salt</li>
  <li>1 cup packed brown sugar [note: use 3/4 cup, maybe less]</li>
  <li>¾ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
  <li>½ cup granulated sugar [note: use a little less than 1/2 cup]</li>
  <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>1 egg yolk</li>
  <li>1 ½ cups roughly chopped white chocolate or white chocolate chips</li>
</ul>

<h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Grease baking sheets or line with parchment paper.</li>
  <li>Sift flour, matcha, baking soda and salt together in a bowl. Beat brown sugar, butter and white sugar together in a large bowl using an electric mixer until blended; beat in vanilla extract, egg and egg yolk until light and creamy.</li>
  <li>Mix flour mixture into creamed butter until dough is just blended; fold in white chocolate using a wooden spoon. Drop cookie dough, 1 heaping tablespoon per cookie, onto the prepared baking sheet 2 to 3 inches apart [note: squish the cookies after heaping].</li>
  <li>Bake 8 to 10 minutes, or until edges are lightly browned. Cool cookies on baking sheet for 3 minutes then transfer to rack to cool completely.</li>
</ul>
