Serves 2

<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
<ul>
  <li>4 to 5 cups vegetable or chicken broth</li>
  <li>2 whole star anise</li>
  <li>1 stick whole cinnamon</li>
  <li>2 large eggs </li>
  <li>2 (7-ounce) packages fresh or frozen udon noodles</li>
  <li>4 to 5 large bok choy leaves, sliced into ribbons</li>
  <li>2 spring onions, thinly sliced</li>
  <li>3 to 4 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
</ul>

<h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
<p>
  Bring the chicken broth to a simmer in a medium saucepan. (The broth should be about 2 inches deep in the pan.) Add the star anise and cinnamon and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes to infuse the broth with the spices. When finished, use a slotted spoon to remove the spices.
</p>
<p>
Crack the eggs into separate measuring cups and slip them into the simmering broth, one at a time. Cook for 2 minutes, then add the noodles and bok choy. Stir very gently to submerge the noodles and bok choy, but so as not to break the eggs. Cook for another 2 minutes, until the whites of the eggs are completely set but the yolks are still loose. (Cook for an additional minute if you like your yolks set.)
</p>
<p>
  Off the heat, gently stir in the soy sauce and the spring onions. Taste and add more soy sauce if necessary. Divide the soup between two bowls and eat immediately.
