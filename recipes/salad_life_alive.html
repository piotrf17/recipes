<h2>VEGGIE PART</h2>

<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
For the veggie stir:
<ul>
  <li>1 pack extra-firm tofu</li>
  <li>soy sauce for marinade (I used ginger soy sauce and some lemon, but anything will do)</li>
  <li>3 small beets</li>
  <li>2 tbs Earth Balance or olive oil</li>
  <li>1 tsp Penzey's Forward (in case you don't have it - mix of black pepper, onion, paprika, garlic, tumeric)</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp cumin</li>
  <li>1/2 yellow onion - chopped finely</li>
  <li>1 garlic clove - minced</li>
  <li>1 cup corn</li>
  <li>1 3/4 cup chopped broccoli</li>
  <li>1 bunch kale</li>
  <li>juice of 1/2 lemon</li>
</ul>

Rice/quinoa mixture:
<ul>
  <li>1 cup brown rice - washed</li>
  <li>1 cup quinoa - washed</li>
  <li>4 cups water</li>
  <li>pinch of salt</li>
  <li>1/2 cup slivered almonds</li>
  <li>1/4 cup cheddar cheese (leave out if vegan, but do NOT use soy/almond cheese as the taste does not go well with the recipe)</li>
</ul>

<h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat oven to 400F. Clean your beets, wrap them in foil and roast in the oven for 50 - 60min or until tender and can be easily pierced with a fork. Cool, then slip off the skin and dice into bite sized pieces.</li>
  <li>Strain and rinse your tofu, then pat dry with paper towels. Cut in 1/4 - 1/2in dice and toss with some soy sauce of your choice. Let stand as you prepare other ingredients.</li>
  <li>Boil 4 cups of water with a pinch of salt and add brown rice. Cook for 15min then add quinoa and cook together for another 15min. When done add almonds and cheddar cheese (optional) and mix well. Set aside.</li>
  <li>Heat 2 tbs of Earth Balance or olive oil in a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Add all the spices (Forward, turmeric, cumin) and cook until fragrant or about 1min. Add garlic and onion and saute for another 5 min. Add tofu and saute until starting to brown or about 8min. Add corn and broccoli and cook until tender. Add kale and cook to reduce in size and soften. Turn off the heat, add beets, lemon juice and set aside.</li>
</ol>

<h2>SAUCE</h2>

<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
<ul>
  <li>2 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
  <li>2 inches of fresh peeled ginger, chopped</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon of Tamari Sauce (or Nama Shoyu or Soy Sauce)</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons of lemon juice (about 1/2 of a lemon)</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons of Tahini (sesame seed butter basically)</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon of olive oil (or flax oil)</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons of water</li>
</ul>
<h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
Combine the first two ingredients in a mini food processor or blender. Blend well. You may need to chop them up finely depending on the efficiency of your blender. Next add in the remaining ingredients and blend until you have a creamy consistency. You may add more water if you would like a less thick sauce.
